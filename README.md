# Documentation

## I / Setup

### A / Prerequisties

Make sure to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) & [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) installed on your computer.

### B / Installation

#### From source

- Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/wafelack/wng.git`
- Run the tests `cargo test`
- Build `cargo build --release`

#### Downloading a binary

- Download the latest binary for the releases
- Put it somewhere in your path

#### With [yarpm](https://github.com/wafelack/yarpm)

- Add `https://github.com/Wafelack/wng/raw/master/` to your sources
- Run `yarpm install wng`

#### With cargo

- Run `cargo install wng`

### C / Configuration

#### Windows

- Create a file named `wng_config.json` at `C:/`
- Copy/paste the following text in this file : 
```json
{
  "name": "<your_name>",
  "email": "<your_email>"
}
```
- Replace the placeholder with your names and emails

#### *Nix

- Create a file named `wng_config.json` in `/etc/`
- Copy/paste the following text in this file : 
```json
{
  "name": "<your_name>",
  "email": "<your_email>"
}
```
- Replace the placeholder with your names and emails

## II / Create a new project

Open the command prompt and run :

```
$ wng new <project_name> [--cpp]
$ cd project_name/
```

Three folders have been created, `tests/`, `src/` and `build/`

In `src/`, you'll find file `main.c[pp]` that contains a basic hello world program.

<br>

## III / Compile and Run

```
$ wng build

$ wng run <args>
Hello World
```

_NOTE : `wng build` will build a debug executable, with flags -W -Wall -Werror -Wextra. To disable this, build in release mode with : `wng build --release`_

### A / Custom build

To build with a custom build, you have to create a `build.py` or `build.rb` file with your code to build.

If you want to specify a special python / ruby interpreter path, add the section `"pyinterpreter" : "path2python"` or `"rbinterpreter" : "path2ruby"` to your project.json.

Minimal python version required : 3.5
Minimal ruby version required : 2.3

Then run your script with `wng build --custom`

### B / Wngbuild library

Wngbuild library provides some useful features to compile your project

It is available in Ruby and Python

*Note : If both build.rb & build.py files exists, build.py will be used*

```py
from wngbuild import * # Import all from wngbuild module

build = BuildProfile(files="src/*.c",output="build/custom/prog.exe" ) # setup a build profile that will compile all files in src/ and place the binary in build/custom/prog.exe
build.cc = "C:\\MinGW\\bin\\gcc.exe" # Setup the compiler (optional, by default "gcc")
build.flags = "-W -Wall -Werror -Wextra" # Setup the flags that the command will be run with (optional)

build.run() # Run the compilation command
build.runOutput() # Run the binary produced by the compilation command (Will raise an error if the compilation command fails)
```

```rb
require_relative "wngbuild"

build=BuildProfile.new("src/*.c", "build/custom/prog") * Setup a build profile
builc.cc="C:\\Program Files\\clang\\bin\\clang.exe"

build.run() * Run compilation
build.runOutput() * Run produced file (Will raise an error if compilation failed)
```

<br>

### C / Checking

You can just check if there is any errors or warnings in your code without producing any binary with `wng check`

## IV / Features

### A / Archive

To create a gunzip archive of your project files, just run `wng archive` and a file called `project.tar.gz` will be created

### B / To reinitialize a project

```
$ wng reinit
Really want to reinit ? Y/N : Y
Project renitialized !
```

### C / To create a header file

```
$ wng header foo
$ cat foo.h
#ifndef _FOO_H_
#define _FOO_H_


#endif /*_FOO_H*/
```

### D / To run tests

Tests have to be in tests/tests.c

To use functions that are in src/ files, just include the header with `#include "../src/<header>.h"`

Then you can run them with `wng test`

### E / Ignoring files

To ignore files, create `.wngignore` file with the files to ignore at compilation.

E.g. : 
```
src/foo/
src/bar.c
```

## V / Libraries

### A / To install a library

```
$ cd yourproject/
$ wng install <source>:<username>/<repo_name>
```

_Available sources are : `github`,`gitlab` & `bitbucket`_
_NOTE : Repository has to have a `lib/` folder inside or wng will refuse to install it_

### B / Publish your library

Create a repository on GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab with your project, library files have to be in a `lib/` folder
