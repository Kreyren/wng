Thanks you for interesting in Wanager!

Here a few rules to respect:

## Code

- All code has to be formated with `rustfmt`.
*If you don't have it installed, run `rustup component add rustfmt` and then use `cargo fmt` to format your code.*

- Provide test for all non trivial code

- All code should be warning free
